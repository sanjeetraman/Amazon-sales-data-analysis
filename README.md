Total sales revenue.
Total number of units sold.
Growth rate in sales compared to previous periods.
Sales by Category:

Revenue and units sold for each product category.
Best and worst-performing categories.
Geographical Analysis:

Sales distribution by region or country.
Top regions contributing to sales.
Customer Insights:

Number of unique customers.
Customer segmentation (e.g., new vs. returning customers).

Time-based Trends:

Monthly/quarterly sales trends.
Seasonal patterns in sales.
